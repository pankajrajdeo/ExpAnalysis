# ExpAnalysis
ExpAnalysis is an RShiny web application that streamlines the analysis and visualization of experimental data for hydrogel tablet formulation, enabling researchers to make informed decisions on factors influencing the outcomes.

This is a Shiny web application designed to analyze the experimental data of a drug formulation. The application allows users to upload their data in CSV format and provides an interface to visualize and analyze the effects of various formulation components on drug properties such as hardness, gel formation, and drug extraction reduction.

This application was built using the Shiny framework, which allows for the creation of interactive web applications using R.

The application can be run on the R Studio. To run the application, the following packages are required: rsconnect, tidyverse, and shiny. These packages can be installed using the R command install.packages().

The source code is available in this repository and can be easily modified to accommodate other datasets.
